Repository to store my answers for the exercises in CS50's Artificial Intelligence course

Currently working on the [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intellience with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/) but didn't opt for a professional certificate as you would have to pay for it, so I created this repository to store all my answers for the exercises in the course.

It is definitely challenging for people who are not familiar with python syntax so you would have to spend more time working on the exercises, but it was fun overall, the lecturer (Brian Yu) was amazing!
